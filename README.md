### Hi there 👋

I'm Zsofi, a self-thought iOS engineer from Budapest. Although I graduated from different areas eventually I found my passion in software development, and I feel extremely privileged to say: I love what I'm doing! ❤️

### My journey 🥾
- Started as a finance and accounting student, worked as an auditor trainee for a few months. 😴
- Realised that I don't want to work as an accountant for the rest of my life. 🙅🏻‍♀️
- Did my MA in Supply Chain Management where I finished with Summa cum laude. 👩🏻‍🎓
- In the meantime, I did a rapid course on Treehouse and learned the basics of Swift. 🍃
- Bought my very first MacBook. 🤑
- Started to create small projects to practice my skills. 🏃🏻‍♀️
- After 3 months I landed a job. 😍
- Trying to learn, evolve, and become a better programmer ever since. 🤓

### My current interests 👀
- Lately, I've been very interested in backend development. 🌓
- I had the opportunity to learn a few things about servers, TypeScript, databases, and also how to optimize them for production usage. ⚙️

### Fun facts 🤩
- Once, I've spent 4 months as a trainee in the European Parliament. 🇪🇺
- I used to swim competitively for 15 years. 🏊‍♀️
- My favorite animals are: dogs 🐶, dolphins 🐬 and cheetahs 🐆
- When watching movies/series and an actor looks familiar to me I cannot concentrate on the movie until I find out where I have seen them before. 🎞
